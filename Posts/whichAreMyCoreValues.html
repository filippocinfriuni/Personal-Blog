				<h2>The spark</h2>
				I realized that I’ve never asked myself the title question after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=391pG_E1wpU" target="_blank">How to find Core Values</a> from Unjaded Jade. A deep reflection followed this youtube video, I was asking myself why I never asked myself the questions in the video. I was also interested in the approach she used, it seems quite simple and quite practical.
				I share the video with you hoping that it sparks a useful reflection.
				While watching the video I recognized the importance of having a set of core values but I have never asked myself which are my core values. I believe it is important because they define me (and you), they are the guide during difficult/stressful moments, and they help you coherently make life decisions. Having a defined set of core values is crucial. I was daunted by the fact that I recognized the relevance of having them yet never thought until now about which core values I wished for.
				<br><br>
				<h2>The friends</h2>
				I was curious to see how I was perceived by my friends. I asked my friends two questions regarding values but without telling them about the video or why I was asking these never seen before questions.
				The first question was: “Which are my core values?”. I feel like I have some values but it is curious to see how you are perceived from the outside. If you already have core values, this question may be a way of checking if your actions and your words are aligned and if you’re perceived as a coherent person. The second question was “If I have changed during the years and how I changed, if there were values that I dropped”, maybe this question could provide some interesting insights about me that I wasn’t aware of.
				Their reaction was hilarious, they didn’t expect me to ask those questions. The answers I received were funny yet brutally honest. I’m grateful to my friends who responded to me sincerely.
				I don’t want to share here the entire conversation I had but I want to briefly summarize my thoughts that followed the chat with my friends:
				<ul>
					<li>I didn’t set my core values and my friends noticed this lack, they perceived that I have values but none stood out as a core value. Therefore I’m actively selecting my core values</li>
					<li>I will check whether my behaviors are coherent with my core values.</li>
					<li>I noticed that selecting core values requires lots of time to think and reflect and evaluate if what I’m choosing deeply represents myself.</li>
				</ul>
				I hope it was helpful, feel free to share with me your values or the reflection that followed the reading.
