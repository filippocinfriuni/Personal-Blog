		<h4><b> #thinking </b></h4>
		<p>
			Writing thoughts and reasonings assists my thinking process.
			<br><br>
			With writing, I can fix explored ideas. This could be a double-edged sword. It can be helpful to check for errors in the reasoning. But it can anchor you to your old ideas. And that may inhibit your improvement.
			The challenge, for me, is to use this collection of ideas as a starting point for further exploration of a topic. So I avoid the anchor trap. Producing some work and then reusing it as a starting point for broadening your knowledge or deepening your understanding of a concept seems powerful to me.
			<br><br>
			When I write it's easier to control the stream of thoughts. 
			I can take a break and analyze the path my brain has taken. I can also evaluate if there were other roads that might have been interesting.
			<br><br>
			Writing online is also a way of sharing ideas hoping to spark interesting conversations.
