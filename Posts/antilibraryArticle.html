<h5>#TheBlackSwan #Taleb</h5>
<br><br>
I learned this concept from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book The Black Swan.
I could barely read more than a couple of pages a day because it sparked a large number of questions and reflections. I heartily suggest reading the book before reading my post, it’s tremendously stimulating and provoking and these characteristics represent well the main idea of my blog.
<br><br>
I am deeply in love with the concept of antilibrary; it is not a new concept, indeed I had an antilibrary for years without knowing it, but Taleb expressed flawlessly the power that follows from being conscious of having an antilibrary.
<br><br>

		<p>The library contains read books, while an antilibrary contains the book you want to read about the topics you haven’t yet explored.<br>
I find extremely attractive the idea of having an antilibrary. The following are the reasons why I included a new section with my antilibrary on my website:
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Having an antilibrary is a daily reminder that you still have to learn, you’re not finished and you have not learned everything. It’s humbling and it reminds you which path you want to follow. It also provides a clear set of information to progress, making it easier.</li>
<li>Having an antilibrary is also a way of sharing your interests, people who see what you want to read may give you precious feedback or suggestions. I think that valuable knowledge can be gained by showing to friends your antilibrary.</li>
<li>It is also a way of showing you still want to learn, you’re hungry for more and this can say much about the person you are.</li>
</ul>
