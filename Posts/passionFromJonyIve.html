		<h4><b> #passion </b></h4>
		<p>
			Covid lockdown hit hard on me, I was bored as hell. While at home, I came across chess streamers and I fell in love with the game of chess. Now it is a big passion.
			<br><br>
			Expressing concepts or ideas is a broad topic and it is difficult. Expressing a feeling, like passion, is a narrower topic but still a difficult one. I want to write about expressing the passion you feel because I want to share with you my journey where I try to improve my communication skills. Besides that, there are good reasons to do it. Two good reasons I can think of for communicating your passion are: you’ll find someone with the same passion and you can share with him experiences and ideas. Another reason could be trying to convince someone that it can be his passion too or that he could fit well in that environment.
			<br><br>
			Having a passion means having an intense feeling for something. Passions are inherently intense, and they are not logical nor precise, they are sensations.
			<br><br>
			I feel I’m not very good at communicating my passion well. I find it difficult to communicate precisely what I mean when it is so intense and so personal. Also, I tend to exaggerate a lot.
			<br><br>
			I want to point out a heartless fact: every person is capable of understanding passions, if they do not get a feel for what I'm trying to (or you're trying to) communicate it is your fault. The burden is always on the speaker and never on the listener. That's the reason pushing me to improve this skill.
			<br><br>
			Everyone can understand and feel others’ passions but not everyone can communicate them well. Jony Ive has an immense passion for design and the feel of tech products and software. He can communicate it quite well, I believe he is an outstanding speaker, and I am in love with his unique way of communicating. Brief presentation: Jony Ive is a product designer, he worked for Apple and has now founded a design firm named LoveFrom.
			<br><br>
			Jony Ive does quite a few interesting things to express his passion, I analyze the ones I find most interesting.
			<ul>
				<li>First of all, he's a master in his field. He already organized knowledge and connected ideas and principles, he has lots of experience and already formed a mature opinion so he can concentrate on the expression of his passion for design rather than getting his thoughts straight while talking.</li>
				<li>His words are precise yet so powerful. He describes everything with a considerable number of adjectives, you can imagine vividly what he is describing. It seems that he can communicate to a deep inner part of the listener. The listener can feel emotions.</li>
				<li>His belief that "ideas can come from the tiniest of voices in the room” emphasizes his ability to listen. Passion is communicated over a conversation, there is a back and forth, and this belief is fundamental to receiving verbal and nonverbal signals from the person. You then modulate your enthusiasm, and your tone to maximize the possibility that the other person can feel your passion the same way.</li>
			</ul>
