		<br>
My experience suggests to me that writing down ideas can help with the thinking process. I’m going to describe what I consider thinking, why I consider it to be that way and the usefulness of writing my thoughts.
I see thinking both as a creative process and an exploring process. It seems obvious to me that thinking is at least a combination of those two processes, I’m gonna prove my assumptions anyway.
<br><br>
A creative process is a process that creates something that was not there before; I can prove with the help of memory that at the end of the process there are things, thoughts that were not there at the beginning. I don’t know how to prove that it always happens for everyone, but I suspect it is this way from my personal experience.
The creation is the end product of an active process, creating requires that you push against the moment of inertia. The same happens while thinking: the brain tends to work for the bare minimum and then run idle, you have to push with your will against this inertial tendency. The thinking process involves also a certain degree of exploring because when you start the process you don’t necessarily know the endpoint, or if you start with an endpoint in mind you don’t know the journey you have to do, the train of thoughts to get there. Hence the mind must explore, and must navigate the options, the resources, and the memories. Sailing without knowing how far is the destination or taking a new undiscovered route is the definition of exploring.
<br><br>
Writing to me, especially writing public available posts, means fixing ideas. Once the ideas are written I don't modify them, they have come into existence, out of my mind, and into the web world. This means that I don’t have to remember all of them because I now have a place where I collect them. I can use my posts as a starting point for further exploration of a topic. It is fascinating, producing some work and then reusing it as a starting point for broadening your knowledge or deepening your understanding of a concept seems powerful to me. it seems so naturally powerful that I can’t describe the reason why.
<br><br>
Before publishing any post I seriously start to look for errors and check coherence and faulty logic. I care about what I spark in readers' minds, I care about giving correct information, trying to reason in the most logical consequential way I can. All this makes the writing of ideas useful to effectively double-check for potential errors.
<br><br>
Writing my thoughts enables me to control the flow. When I think I want the mind free to run, explore, connect, and create; I don’t want to be bothered by the verification duty or by formally defining everything I’ve thought. When the mind runs free I’ve learned that there are two main risks: dead ends and loops

. Writing enables me to take a break, analyze the road that my brain has taken so far, all the visited roads, and finally reevaluate where I can go next, which roads might be interesting.
<br><br>
In the end, writing online is mainly a way of sharing ideas with you hoping to spark interesting conversations or insinuating doubts, and asking questions together to arrive at a better understanding of a topic.
